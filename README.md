# Project 2

Project 2 implements a mini 'Deep Learning Framework' using only only pytorchâ€™s tensor operations and the stan-dard math library, hence in particular without autograd or theneural-network modules.
The objective we fixed ourselves is to design a framework capable of:
- Creating fully connected Networks with desired numberof nodes and layers
- Apply different activation functions
- Apply different losses
- Apply different weight initialization
- Apply dropout
- Choose between different optimizers
- Use a scheduler 
- 

To run various examples created with this framework run the test.py file.

Following libraries would be required :
Pytorch
